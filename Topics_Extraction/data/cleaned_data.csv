birmingham selma really outraged extremist behavior bull connor jim clark toward negros rather believing genuine equality negros think weve got see now makes struggle much difficult result this see many problems existing today growing difficult its something often overlooked negros generally live worse slums today   years ago north schools segregated today  supreme courts decision desegregation

rooted north its still deeply rooted south leads say something another discussion hit great deal socalled white backlash would like honestly say white backlash merely new name old phenomenon its something came shouts black power negros engaged riots watts instance fact state california voted fair housing bill existence anybody shouted black power anybody rioted watts may well shouts black power riots watts harlems areas consequences white backlash rather cause them necessary see never single solid monistic determined commitment part vast majority white americans whole question civil

justice feel violence create social problems solve real sense impractical negro even think mounting violent revolution united states continue condemn riots continue say brothers sisters way continue affirm another way time necessary vigorous condemning conditions cause persons feel must engage riotous activities condemn riots think america must see riots develop thin air certain conditions

indivisible liberty justice all certain things must do job ahead must massive positive must develop massive action programs united states america order deal problems mentioned now order develop massive action programs weve got get rid one two false notions continue exist society one notion time solve problem racial injustice im sure youve heard idea notion almost something flow time miraculously cure evils heard again those theyre often sincere people say negros allies white community slow nice patient continue pray   years problem work time solve problem think answer myth time neutral used either constructively destructively im absolutely convinced forces ill nation extreme rightists nation often used time much effectively forces goodwill may well repent generation merely vitriolic words bad people violent actions bad people appalling silence indifference good people sit around say wait time somewhere must come see social progress never rolls wheels inevitability comes tireless efforts persistent work dedicated individuals without hard work time becomes ally primitive forces social stagnation must time must realize time always right right now theres another notion gets out its around everywhere its south its north its california nation its notion legislation cant solve problem cant anything area project argument contend youve got change heart cant change heart legislation now ill first one say real need lot heart changing country believe changing heart preach it believe need conversion many instances regeneration use theological terms would first say race

bill_gates,4.txt,thank you kedest welcome everyone th annual grand challenges meeting isnt typical grand challenges event tonight were also celebrating th anniversary world health summit were honored worlds important leaders fight global poverty disease here too director general tedros who prime minister solberg norway chancellor merkel joined us its appropriate were holding years meeting germany grand challenges identifying important unsolved problems  soliciting best ideas solve them actually german idea started grand challenges program  years ago based work german mathematician david hilbert hilbert probably famous speech gave paris mathematics conference  there encouraged fellow mathematicians tackle list  problems never solved before hilbert optimistic problems would solved short order instance list questions included proving reimann hypothesis distribution prime numbers hilbert told students if awaken slept  years first question would be riemann hypothesis proven its worth asking prediction panned out well hilbert dead  years    looks like instincts right although many attempted still verified proof reimann hypothesis again  hilberts  problems solved partially solved importantly process solving led new fields hilbert imagine  like quantum mechanics based grand challenges hilberts questions  passionate broader process innovation always succeed do exceed even bestcase scenarios especially true fight global poverty disease tonight would like share  examples  stories recent progress first story antibiotic azithromycin team researchers croatian pharmaceutical company discovered back  initially proved effective treating trachoma  leading cause infectious blindness sure team croatian scientists hoping began research guess wouldve happy drug could save millions peoples sight thats end story years clinicians using azithromycin field developed hunch might broader benefits treating trachoma   tested hunch health workers niger malawi tanzania distributed one azithromycin placebo roughly  children highmortality areas children didnt trachoma wanted see would help stay healthy did azithromycin reduced deaths average  children five years  infants   months old child mortality cut half since  still  million children  died last year azithromycin  yearold drug  could help us cut number even more now thinking best deliver drug poor countries were testing see azithromycin save newborns lives give shortly theyre bornor mothers pregnancy fact formulating new guidelines use azithromycin right now drug could saving lives next year goes show innovation doesnt always mean inventing something new sometimes old drugs still new tricks keep needs poorest topofmind work help many people initially expected mosquitoborne illness another area beat bestcase scenario example goal eliminate malaria year  know ambitious goal especially since weve seen uptick number malaria cases places subsaharan africa goal could attainable technologies like gene drive essentially scientists could introduce gene mosquito population would either suppress populationor prevent spreading malaria decades difficult test idea discovery crispr research became lot easier last month team research consortium target malaria announced theyd completed studies mosquito populations fully suppressed clear test series laboratory cages filled  mosquitos each its promising start theres dengue fever dengue spread species mosquito called aedes aegypti early s scientific community trying failing vaccine years scientist named scott oneill idea instead vaccinating people treated aedes aegypti mosquito insects contain bacteria called wolbachia aedes aegypti not oneill team believed introducing wolbachia aedes would shorten mosquitos lifespan killing mosquito time transmit dengue decided fund project one initial grand challenges grantees didnt work planned first wolbachia wasnt killing mosquitos shortening lifespan something good made impossible aedes transmit dengue today scott oneills world malaria program conducting studies cities around globe including yogyakarta indonesia exactly half city wolbachia mosquitos half doesnt wont official results  study concludes interesting anecdotal results yogyakarta locals say home prices going wolbachia half city  size day care classes mothers control half yogyakarta want young children wolbachia are even indications wolbachia might prevent aedes transmitting diseases like chikungunya zika one final story its vaccines ill begin whats among hardest vaccines develop  one tuberculosis one licensed tb vaccine bcg almost  years old doesnt provide substantial protection pulmonary tb adults disease continues devastate workingage populations especially south asia africa last month however may breakthrough quarter world population bacteria causes tb doesnt yet disease itself reported new tb vaccine m showed significant efficacy preventing tb among people already infected m tuberculosis whats exciting tb vaccine singular innovation its part wider trend many discovering new vaccinesyoure discovering entirely new ways make vaccines example past  years weve working curevac ag germany curevac biotech company theyre developing platforms use bodys machinery produce vaccines administered mrna  molecules used turn genetic information proteins implications mrna vaccines enormous could produced cheaply quickly  maybe even quickly enough respond new global pandemic something like ebola theory however recently now curevac successfully introduced mrna vaccines small large animals last year testing mrna vaccines flu rabies found much durable standard versions robert koch german biologist discovered m tuberculosis bacterium berlin back s said if efforts led greater success usual its because strayed onto paths gold still lying wayside potential tb vaccine new advances mrna platform its clear theres lot gold pursuit new vaccine technology were discovering new tools were also able give people need example new tb vaccine approved could deliver via global network health care workers already immunizes  million children year thats leaders like chancellor merkel prime minister solberg give generously gavi worlds vaccine fund think using mrna vaccines combat outbreaks like ebola vaccines could paired response efforts developed coalition epidemic preparedness innovations nations like norway germany also support brings final point its good leaders government leaders science room tonight need other policymakers room tools today arent enough solve challenges were facing whether its responding pandemics reducing child mortality eradicating malaria need innovations like ones ive described scientists here innovations get people need governments support first last miles innovative process fund research help deliver outcomes director general tedros going speak this hell talk whos sdg action plan describes accelerate progress governments align behind  invest  certain areas innovation work crucial ever fewer fewer nations willing it many countries retreating world need leaders like prime minister solberg chancellor merkel take opposite course fact need countries like germany increase role its one reasons today announced foundation opening new european office berlin ive told exciting scientific research tonight its still research whether remains way  leaves lab helps people world  function many leaders step support science hopeful will,well hilbert dead years looks like instincts right although many attempted still verified proof reimann hypothesis,1822,kedest grand challenges identifying important unsolved problems soliciting best ideas solve them says program based work german mathematician david hilbert process solving problems led

china again its fitting meeting reinvented toilet expo recent decades china made great progress improving health sanitation hundreds millions people president xis toilet revolution underscores chinas commitment accelerating progress safe sanitation china opportunity help launch new category innovative decentralized sanitation solutions benefit millions people worldwide although people room come varied backgrounds  government private sector development banks academia philanthropy  one reason half worlds population doesnt safe sanitation need lead healthy productive lives government want find way solve large growing problem human waste especially urban areas private sector  new advances technology  see market opportunity meet needs  billion people worldwide opportunities scale dont come along often might guess whats beaker  youd right human feces small amount feces could contain many  trillion rotavirus particles  billion shigella bacteria  parasitic worm eggs places without safe sanitation much one small beakers worth environment pathogens cause diseases like diarrhea cholera typhoid kill nearly  children age five every year unsafe sanitation also puts huge economic burden countries least afford it globally costs estimated  billion year form higher health costs lost productivity wages problem get worse dont something it population growth urbanization water scarcity next decades make even difficult cities africa asia  cities already struggling inadequate sanitation systems  break cycle disease poverty associated unsafe sanitation became interested sanitation decade ago stopped working full time microsoft melinda began traveling frequently poor countries visited communities children playing lanes filled human waste pit latrines emptied hand stench community toilets bad people didnt want use them families drank water contaminated human waste dimension poverty hadnt seen before motivated us try something it wasnt degradation suffering people face every day something thats essential natural human beings also much melinda seek achieve saving improving lives cant accomplished unless people everywhere safe sanitation became clear us world going continue making progress diseases poverty wed create new way looking  eventually solving  global sanitation crisis  posed question group scientists engineers possible leapfrog longaccepted gold standard sanitation flush toilets sewers treatment plants could come affordable approach could kill pathogens keep pace needs fastgrowing urban areas  without requiring sewer infrastructure reliance scarce water resources continuous electricity operate people skeptical achievable get it its hard envision totally different way something deeply rooted feels like the way things are early life career time the way things were computing big mainframe computer large corporations governments could afford us another idea dreamed personal computers anyone could use lot people told us crazy believed found people shared vision now people cant imagine world way back day mainframe believe possible achieve something like sanitation thats invested  million last seven years working partners develop new generation nonsewered sanitation technologies two main things knew accomplish first make easier cheaper effectively manage fecal sludge across sanitation service chain diagram shows scale problem global south  fecal sludge safely managed cities problem much worse one city south asia  human waste untreated many countries yet even reporting much waste getting treated untreated human waste unlined pit latrines contaminates groundwater around peoples homes collected manually trucks dumped nearby fields bodies water collected sewers never gets treated point far goal world set  everyone using safelymanaged toilet help address problem worked partners develop smallscale treatment plant process fecal sludge biosolids pit latrines septic tanks sewers selfpowered technology  located almost anywhere  called omniprocessor takes human waste kills dangerous pathogens converts resulting materials products potential commercial value  like clean water electricity fertilizer second challenge invent pathogenkilling toilet also selfcontained  tiny treatment plant built in call reinvented toilet actually collection innovative technologies use different approaches break human waste destroy germs  leaving behind clean water solids used fertilizer    disposed safely outdoors without treatment initial demand reinvented toilet places like schools apartment buildings community toilet facilities adoption multiunit toilets increases  cost continues drop  new category reinvented toilets become available use peoples homes  developing countries people limited resources developed countries people want need offgrid household toilet let show one example reinvented toilet could look like household use  designed swiss engineering firm helbling addition partners made great progress
